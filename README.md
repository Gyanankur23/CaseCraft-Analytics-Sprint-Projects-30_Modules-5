## 🔚 Wrap-Up Modules (31–35 → 1–5)

| Module | Title | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 1/5 | Audience Engagement Heatmap | Analyze post timing, format, and domain resonance |
| 2/5 | Reusable Logic Block Library | Curated code blocks for segmentation, clustering, forecasting |
| 3/5 | Seasonal Demand Forecast (FMCG) | Time series modeling and inventory strategy |
| 4/5 | Meta-Analysis of All Projects | Strategic synthesis across sprint modules |
| 5/5 | Portfolio Builder Notebook | Final export-ready portfolio with summaries and reuse flags |

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Clarity-first:** Every module is built for readability, reproducibility, and modular reuse  
- **Audience-aware:** Visuals and summaries are tuned for LinkedIn, GitHub, and challenge platforms  
- **Strategic closure:** Wrap-up modules synthesize insights and prepare assets for deployment  
- **Emotional intelligence:** Many modules reflect real-world frustration, recovery, and peer protection themes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- Prophet, Statsmodels (for time series)  
- Colab (for markdown/code separation)  
- GitHub/Notion (for deployment)

---

## 📌 Deployment Notes

- All notebooks are markdown-separated and Colab-ready  
- Synthetic datasets included for frictionless execution  
- Visuals embedded inline for portfolio export  
- Reuse flags and summaries auto-generated in Module 5/5

---

## 🎯 How to Use

1. Clone or download the sprint repository  
2. Open any notebook in Colab or Jupyter  
3. Run the synthetic dataset generator (if needed)  
4. Explore logic blocks, visualizations, and summaries  
5. Use wrap-up modules for synthesis, export, or teaching kits

## 🏁 Final Reflection

This sprint is more than a technical showcase—it's a strategic, emotional, and community-driven journey. From scam recovery logic to influencer dashboards, every module reflects a blend of rigor and empathy. The wrap-up modules ensure that the sprint ends not with a fade, but with a launch.

Built with clarity. Delivered with care.
